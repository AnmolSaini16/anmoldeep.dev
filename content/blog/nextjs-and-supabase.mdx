I've been exploring options for my upcoming side project and initially settled on using DrizzleORM with Postgres alongside Next.js. However, I recently stumbled upon Supabase, which seems to offer robust features and smooth integration for app development.

My goal was to create a straightforward yet efficient polling platform where users can easily create polls and others can vote on them. I have added the project link and repo at the end.

I found these Supabase features to be excellent and intuitive, making project setup and scaling a breeze.
